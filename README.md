# Tint
terminal color schemes made easy and modular

# How To Use it
It requires 2 arguments:
1. the path to the generator
2. the path to the INI file containing the color scheme

the generator file can be anything executable (script or executable), Picasso run it and give it the extracted values from the INI file
as of now, i haven't made an generators or color schemes, but they will come, that's a promise
